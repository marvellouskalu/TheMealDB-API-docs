# Authentication

To get started with this API, use the test API key **"1"** during development of your app or for educational use.

This is how you can use the API Key
```bash
www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/
```


However you must become a supporter if releasing publicly on an appstore.
Also it is important to note that **test key may be revoked at any time if abused.**

## API Production Key Upgrade

All supporters have access to the beta version of the API which allows mutiple ingredient filters.
You also get access to adding your own meals and images. You can also list the full database rather than limited to 100 items.
Please [signup](https://www.paypal.com/webapps/hermes?token=6L064319FS861981L&useraction=commit) on Paypal and we will email you the upgrade.
